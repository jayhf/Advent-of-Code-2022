# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

After years of wanting to learn Rust, I decided to take advantage of a friendly competition at work to have fun and learn Rust.
I typically went for the solution I thought I could implement the fastest without being overly hacky.
The solutions are as is from when I wrote them, perhaps with a few minutes of tidying after.
I went in with  very little rust experience, just having attempted AoC for a week or two a few years back, but I started
reading a lot of the docs and stack overflow.
Rust hasn't been the fastest language to write, especially for early problems before I was comfortable with the syntax.
However, it's been a lot of fun to write, tends to be fairly elegant, and its safety saved considerable time debugging.
I've also really appreciated the performance in later problems.
I never got on the global leaderboard, but came out having learned a significant amount of Rust and having had fun.
